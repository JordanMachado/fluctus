threejs-starter-kit
===================

It uses Three.js, datGUI and Greensock as depencies.
I also added a few Three.js extra classes from the examples for post-processing.

After cloning install all node dependencies :
`npm i`

Then install the libraries :
`bower install`

Then launch gulp to build :
`gulp`

You are good to go !
